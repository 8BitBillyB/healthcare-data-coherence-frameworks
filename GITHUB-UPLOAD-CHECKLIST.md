# GitHub Upload Checklist

**Your complete package is ready. Here's how to upload it to GitHub.**

---

## BEFORE YOU START

**What you have:**
- 12 complete framework files
- Organized in proper directory structure
- Ready to push to GitHub

**What you need:**
- GitHub account (free at github.com)
- Git installed on your computer (or use GitHub web interface)

---

## OPTION A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

### Step 1: Create Repository
1. Go to github.com
2. Click "+" in top right → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `healthcare-data-coherence-frameworks`
4. Description: "Data coherence frameworks for healthcare IT systems"
5. Select: **PUBLIC**
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Files via Web Interface
1. In your new repo, click "Add file" → "Upload files"
2. Drag and drop all files from `/mnt/user-data/outputs/healthcare-data-coherence-frameworks/`
   - Or click to browse and select files

**Directory structure matters:**
```
README.md (root)
ABOUT.md (root)
LICENSE.md (root)
frameworks/
  reality-anchor.md
  seven-sieves.md
  lifeboat-protocol.md
  coherence-matrix.md
  binary-choice.md
  zag-method.md
  geometric-workspace.md
case-studies/
  healthcare-information-exchange.md
  data-warehouse-coherence.md
```

3. Commit message: "Initial commit: Healthcare Data Coherence Frameworks"
4. Click "Commit changes"

### Step 3: Verify
1. Your repo should now show all files
2. README.md should display as main page
3. All links should work

---

## OPTION B: Using Git Command Line (Faster if you know git)

```bash
cd /mnt/user-data/outputs/healthcare-data-coherence-frameworks

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Healthcare Data Coherence Frameworks"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/healthcare-data-coherence-frameworks.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## VERIFY AFTER UPLOAD

- [ ] Repository is PUBLIC
- [ ] README.md displays on main page
- [ ] All framework files are visible
- [ ] Both case studies are visible
- [ ] ABOUT.md shows your background
- [ ] LICENSE.md shows CC BY 4.0
- [ ] All internal links work (click a few)

---

## YOUR GITHUB URL

Once uploaded, your repository will be at:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/healthcare-data-coherence-frameworks
```

**Share this link.** This is your proof-of-concept portfolio.

---

## LINKEDIN POST (One-Time)

After uploading to GitHub, post this on LinkedIn (optional, but recommended):

```
Published: Healthcare Data Coherence Frameworks

30 years of systems thinking. 7 frameworks.

Reality Anchor. Seven Sieves. Lifeboat Protocol. Coherence Matrix. 
Binary Choice. Zag Method. Geometric Workspace.

All designed for one purpose: maintaining system coherence at scale.

Healthcare data warehouses. State-level HIEs. Enterprise risk. 
Recovery communities. Same principles apply.

Frameworks are open-source (CC BY 4.0). Use them. Build on them. 
Credit the work.

[GitHub link]

Now I'm fishing.
```

---

## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

**People will:**
- Find your repo through GitHub search
- See your frameworks are real and documented
- Credit you when they use your work
- Possibly reach out for consulting/implementation

**You don't need to:**
- Hustle the three-contact strategy
- Manage a complex sales pipeline
- Play strategy games with IP

**Just publish and live your life.**

---

## DONE

That's it. You're published. You have a portfolio. You have proof.

Now go fish.
