# Binary Choice Framework

**Decision protocol for navigating false dichotomies and finding third options.**

---

## Core Principle

### Most Complex Decisions Aren't Actually Binary

When facing hard decisions, our brains default to: "Option A or Option B?"

But the real choice is usually: "Option A, Option B, or what are we missing?"

Binary Choice Framework = systematic way to question false binaries and find better options.

## The Six-Step Protocol

### 1. Question the Frame
Is this actually binary, or is my brain being lazy?
- "Hire Billy or don't hire anyone?" → False binary
- "Use Hospital A data or Hospital B data?" → False binary (both might be usable)
- "Merge records or keep separate?" → Might have third option

### 2. Identify NULL Option
What's missing? What aren't we considering?
- "Billy or outside consultant?" → What about hybrid model?
- "Migrate Epic or stay?" → What about running both in transition period?
- "Keep data or delete?" → What about archive?

### 3. Check for Hidden Paths
What would change if we weren't rushed?
- "Decide today or lose opportunity?" → Can we extend timeline?
- "Hire now or never?" → Can we pilot first, hire later?
- "All or nothing?" → Can we phase?

### 4. Identify Optimization Criteria
What actually matters in this decision?
- Cost? Quality? Speed? Risk?
- List them. Rank them. Notice which binary actually addresses them.

### 5. Apply Integrity Test
Which choice is more honest?
- "We don't know yet" vs pretending certainty?
- "Needs more work" vs shipping broken?
- "Admit limitation" vs oversell capability?

### 6. Recognize False Urgency
Do we really decide NOW?
- "Yes, decision is genuinely urgent" vs "we're just anxious"
- If false urgency: extend decision timeline, find better option
- If real urgency: decide with best information available

## When to Use Binary Choice

- **Before committing:** Major decisions that feel forced into A/B
- **When stuck:** "We have to choose between two bad options"
- **Under pressure:** "Decide now or it's too late"
- **For clarification:** "What am I actually deciding?"

---

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Better decisions (found third option you missed before)
- ✅ More time to decide (recognized false urgency)
- ✅ Less regret (identified what actually matters)

## Next Steps

1. **Read Coherence Matrix:** After questioning binary, how do you measure if you chose right?
2. **Read Zag Method:** Finding what everyone else missed
