# Lifeboat Protocol

**Recovery framework when incoherent data is detected. When systems drift or data quality breaks down, systematically recover to coherence.**

---

## Core Principle

### When Coherence Breaks, Don't Panic—Recover

Incoherent data WILL slip through (Bad merge happens. Duplicate record created. Conflicting data accepted). The question isn't "if"—it's "when?" and "how do you recover?"

Lifeboat Protocol = systematic recovery when coherence fails.

## The Four Steps

### Step 1: STOP
**Don't accept current data. Don't merge more records. Don't propagate incoherence further.**

Triggers:
- 3+ Seven Sieves violations in data
- Explicit duplicate records detected
- Data from Source A contradicts Source B on same fact
- System detects incoherence in data you thought was coherent

Action: **STOP the current operation immediately.**

Example:
- You're merging Hospital A patient 12345 with Hospital B patient 12345
- During merge: Hospital A says "Age 42", Hospital B says "Age 15"
- Same person? No. Error? Yes.
- STOP: Don't merge these. Flag for review.

---

### Step 2: RESET
**Go back to last verified, coherent state.**

Question: "What do we know for certain?"

Action:
1. Identify when data became incoherent
2. Restore to last verified state BEFORE incoherence
3. Document what was lost (data from the failed merge)
4. Prepare to re-integrate properly

Example:
- Incoherent data detected at 14:30
- Last verified coherent state: 13:15 (75 minutes ago)
- Action: Restore warehouse to 13:15 backup
- Lost: Data merged between 13:15-14:30 (approximately 500 records)

---

### Step 3: RESTATE
**What do we ACTUALLY know? What's proven true vs what's uncertain?**

Review the facts:
- Which records were definitely correct?
- Which records had problems?
- Which sources are trustworthy?
- Which sources caused the incoherence?

Actions:
1. Sort data into: Verified good / Conflicting / Uncertain
2. Identify the source of incoherence (which data source? which field? which rule failed?)
3. Establish: "We know X for certain, Y is questionable, Z is unknown"

Example:
- Hospital A data: Appears good (passed Seven Sieves)
- Hospital B data: 80% good, 20% conflicting with Hospital A
- Source of problem: Hospital B loading old data as current
- What we know: Hospital A is more recent, more reliable for this period

---

### Step 4: RESUME
**Re-integrate with enhanced validation.**

Actions:
1. Reapply Seven Sieves more strictly
2. Add Reality Anchor checks (NULL vs 0)
3. Get domain expert review (not just system validation)
4. Re-merge data one record at a time (not bulk)
5. Monitor closely for re-emergence of incoherence

Example:
- RESET: Restored to 13:15
- RESTATE: Hospital B data is problematic
- RESUME: Re-integrate Hospital A (all passes Seven Sieves)
- Then re-integrate Hospital B with manual spot checks (first 50 records reviewed by human)
- Monitor: Check for incoherence signals

## When to Trigger Lifeboat Protocol

### Automatic Triggers

❌ **3+ Seven Sieves violations** in same record
- Data fails Relevance, Specificity, AND Consistency? → LIFEBOAT

❌ **Explicit duplicate detection**
- Same patient appears twice in merged data? → LIFEBOAT

❌ **Source contradiction**
- Hospital A: "Patient on Medication X"
- Hospital B: "Patient NOT on Medication X" (explicitly confirmed)
- Same timeframe? → LIFEBOAT

❌ **Temporal incoherence**
- Death date before birth date
- Follow-up before procedure
- Discharge before admission
- → LIFEBOAT

❌ **Batch failure rate exceeds threshold**
- 15% of incoming records fail validation
- Threshold is 5%
- → LIFEBOAT (don't accept this batch)

### Manual Triggers

✋ **Domain expert says "something's wrong"**
- Clinician: "This data doesn't look right"
- Analyst: "I don't trust this merge"
- Data scientist: "Quality metrics are degrading"
- → LIFEBOAT (systematic review triggered)

✋ **Audit discovers problems**
- Post-merge quality check finds issues
- Patient safety concern identified
- → LIFEBOAT (investigate and recover)

## Success Metrics

**How do you know Lifeboat Protocol is working?**

- ✅ **Fewer incoherent records in warehouse:** Incoherence caught early, not propagated
- ✅ **Faster recovery:** From incoherence detection to fix
- ✅ **High confidence:** Team trusts data because recovery is systematic
- ✅ **Low customer impact:** Merge failures handled internally, don't affect users
- ✅ **Audit trail:** Every STOP/RESET/RESTATE is logged

## Next Steps

1. **Read Coherence Matrix:** How to measure if you're actually coherent
2. **Read Seven Sieves:** Prevent incoherence before STOP is needed
3. **Define your thresholds:** At what point do YOU trigger Lifeboat?
4. **Test recovery:** Do you have a working backup/restore process?
