# Zag Method

**Strategic positioning by recognizing consensus gaps. When everyone zigs right, the unexploited space is on the left.**

## Core Principle

### Find the Gap in Consensus

Most organizations copy what successful organizations do. They all "zig" the same direction.

The Zag = the unexploited direction. Where everyone ISN'T looking.

Zag Method = systematic way to find that gap and build competitive advantage there.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Identify the Consensus
What is everyone doing?
- "All healthcare IT vendors sell on-premise solutions"
- "All data warehouses prioritize volume/speed"
- "All risk frameworks are compliance-focused"

### Step 2: Understand Why
Is the consensus right, or just repeated?
- Do companies choose on-premise because it's better, or because everyone else does?
- Do warehouses measure volume because it matters, or because it's easy to measure?
- Do risk frameworks focus on compliance because it's what works, or because it's auditable?

### Step 3: Find the Gap
What's the opposite of consensus? What isn't anyone doing?
- Consensus: "Volume metrics" → Gap: "Coherence metrics"
- Consensus: "Compliance-focused risk" → Gap: "Decision-focused risk"
- Consensus: "All-or-nothing data integration" → Gap: "Phased, coherence-first integration"

### Step 4: Test the Gap
Is this gap real, or am I just being contrarian?
- Would organizations want this?
- Is there a real problem the gap solves?
- Could this actually work?

### Step 5: Build in the Gap
Occupy the space no one else is in.

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Competitive differentiation (you're the only one doing this)
- ✅ Market traction (organizations want this)
- ✅ Premium pricing (gap creates value)
