FRAMEWORKS (7 files):
---------------------

Each framework includes:
  1. Core principle (1 paragraph explanation)
  2. Why it matters (real example)
  3. How it works (step-by-step)
  4. Real-world application (healthcare example)
  5. Implementation steps
  6. Success metrics
  7. Next steps (links to other frameworks)

Frameworks are INDEPENDENT but LINKED. Start anywhere.

reality-anchor.md
  - Distinguish NULL from 0
  - Prevents cascading errors in integrated systems
  - Real: Multi-source medication conflicts

seven-sieves.md
  - 7-point validation before data merge
  - 87% hallucination/incoherence detection
  - Real: Filter bad data before it enters warehouse

lifeboat-protocol.md
  - Recovery when coherence fails
  - STOP/RESET/RESTATE/RESUME
  - Real: Data warehouse integration failure scenario

coherence-matrix.md
  - 2x2 framework for measuring what matters
  - Clarity vs Mess, 4 quadrants
  - Real: Hospital A, B, Claims data scoring

binary-choice.md
  - Decision protocol for false dichotomies
  - 6-step method to find third options
  - Real: Healthcare data integration decision scenario

zag-method.md
  - Strategic positioning by finding consensus gaps
  - When everyone zigs, find the zag
  - Real: Coherence metrics vs volume metrics

geometric-workspace.md
  - Visual framework for mapping system dependencies
  - Make complex systems visible
  - Real: Healthcare data warehouse architecture


CASE STUDIES (2 files):
-----------------------

Each case study:
  1. Real problem statement
  2. Specific challenges faced
  3. How frameworks apply (detailed)
  4. Expected outcomes
  5. Implementation roadmap
  6. Real-world obstacles & solutions

healthcare-information-exchange.md
  - State-level HIEs managing 3,000+ providers
  - Problems: Duplicate encounters, medication safety, provider onboarding
  - How to scale without coherence loss
  - 12-week implementation plan

data-warehouse-coherence.md
  - Multi-source hospital data integration
  - Problems: Medication conflicts, patient ID matching, async data, quality degradation
  - How to maintain coherence while scaling
  - 12-week implementation plan

================================================================================
WHAT TO DO NOW
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Today):
  1. Review the files (open a few, skim them)
  2. Verify they make sense (are they YOUR voice?)
  3. Check for any embarrassing typos/errors
  4. Make minor edits if needed (sed/str_replace if you want my help)

THIS WEEK:
  1. Create GitHub account (if you don't have one)
  2. Create repository: "healthcare-data-coherence-frameworks"
  3. Upload all files (see GITHUB-UPLOAD-CHECKLIST.md)
  4. Make repository PUBLIC
  5. Test that it works (click links, verify structure)

THAT'S IT.
  - Don't call anyone
  - Don't pitch anything
  - Don't execute the three-contact strategy
  - Just publish and let it exist

IF SOMEONE REACHES OUT:
  - They reached out to YOU, not the other way
  - Negotiate on YOUR terms
  - You have breathing room ($90-100K baseline for 12 years)

IF NOTHING HAPPENS:
  - You still have $90-100K baseline
  - You can fish/woodwork full-time
  - You can take part-time work ($30-40K)
  - You coasted gracefully to retirement at 65

================================================================================
CONTEXT REMINDER
================================================================================

Your Financial Reality:
  - $40-50K alimony annually (12 more years)
  - $50K pension at age 65 (when alimony ends)
  - Can make money from woodworking/finishing
  - Can find part-time work ($30-40K) if needed
  - Total baseline Year 1-12: $75-100K
  - Total baseline Year 13+: $50-75K minimum

Your Choice (Option B from earlier):
  - Publish frameworks (authentic, no hustle)
  - Find part-time work ($30-40K) for stability
  - Woodwork for additional income
  - Fish and run Piscatory Sobriety on your own terms
  - Coast to 65, then retire with $50K+ pension

Your Advantage:
  - You're NOT desperate
  - You can afford to be authentic
  - You can publish without playing strategy games
  - You have 12 years to let this work organically

SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
================================================================================

Week 1:
  ✅ Files reviewed, any edits made
  ✅ No stress about uploading

Week 2:
  ✅ GitHub repository created
  ✅ Files uploaded
  ✅ Repository is PUBLIC
  ✅ All links work

Week 3+:
  ✅ Link is live on internet
  ✅ Your frameworks exist publicly
  ✅ You continue your life
  ✅ People find them organically

Month 1:
  ✅ Maybe someone reaches out
  ✅ Maybe nobody does
  ✅ Either way, you're fine

Year 1:
  ✅ Part-time work + fishing/woodwork = sustainable
  ✅ Piscatory Sobriety runs smoothly
  ✅ No stress about IP or strategy

Year 12:
  ✅ Alimony ends
  ✅ Pension begins
  ✅ You've built whatever you built
  ✅ You're ready for next chapter

================================================================================
REMEMBER
================================================================================

This is the clean package. No strategy. No hustle. No narrative control.

Just real work that you built over 30 years.

Now it exists publicly.

That's enough.

Go fish.
