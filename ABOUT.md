## Background

I spent 30 years preventing organizational systems from becoming incoherent when they scale.

### Professional Timeline

**1990-2001: Foundational Healthcare IT**
- Database administrator across multiple healthcare organizations

- Designed data migration for practice mergers
- Prevented 3+ major data loss incidents

**2001-2008: ProHealth Systems (7 years)**
- Senior Database Administrator managing 25+ concurrent systems
- Administered databases worth $100M+
- Built data integrity frameworks for 300+ physician practices
- Solved the "Wilson Problem" (transaction naming coherence)
- Managed "Leon Project" go-live decision protocol

**2008-2015: Healthcare Data Consulting**
- Architected data governance frameworks
- Consulted on multi-system integration
- Designed database coherence validation
- Developed decision-making frameworks

**2015-2023: Independent Systems Architecture**
- Continued healthcare data consulting
- Applied systems thinking to enterprise problems
- Formalized 7 core frameworks

**2023-Present: Piscatory Sobriety + Framework Development**
- Running community recovery program (Piscatory Sobriety)
- Operationalized systems thinking for recovery coherence
- Documented frameworks for healthcare IT, enterprise risk, AI governance
- Applied frameworks to real organizational challenges

## The Wilson Problem (ProHealth, 2001-2008)

### The Challenge

Transaction naming in medical billing system:
- Medicare Payment
- Medicaid Adjustment
- Blue Cross Write-off
- Workers Comp Payment
- (New insurance type? Add new transaction name)

**Problem:** Every new insurance type required code changes. System became brittle, unmaintainable.

### The Solution

I argued (voraciously, apparently earning the "Wilson" nickname from Tom Hanks movie) for separating transaction TYPE from CLASSIFICATION:

- **Transaction TYPE:** Payment / Adjustment / Write-off (immutable)
- **Insurance METADATA:** Medicare / Medicaid / Blue Cross (scalable)

**Result:** New insurance types added without code changes. System scaled cleanly.

### Why This Matters

**Principle:** Don't hardcode business logic into data structure. Separate what the data IS from what it's CLASSIFIED AS.

This principle applies to:
- Healthcare data coherence (Reality Anchor)
- Database field naming conventions
- Any system that needs to scale

## The Leon Project (ProHealth Go-Live, 2003)

### The Challenge

Implementation had planned go-live dates across a 6-month window. Every proposed date had fatal flaws. Team was stuck: "Everything will fail."

### The Solution

I systematically crossed out every date that wouldn't work, forced explicit reasoning about WHY each wouldn't work, until one viable option remained.

We chose a weekend. Blizzard hit. With Leon (our mascot/grounding point), we prevailed anyway.

### Why This Matters

**Principle:** When everything seems impossible, systematically eliminate impossible options until only viable path remains. Binary Choice Framework in practice.

## Why I Built These Frameworks

After 30 years, I noticed a pattern:

**Organizations fail not from lack of complexity, but from loss of coherence.**

- Database systems drift and become unreliable
- Healthcare networks fragment despite excellent IT
- Risk portfolios lose coherence as they grow
- Recovery communities drift when they lose structure

**The cure is the same in every context:** Maintain coherence through systematic frameworks.

So I documented them.

## Piscatory Sobriety (2023-Present)

I started running community recovery fishing trips called "Piscatory Sobriety"—applying systems thinking to recovery community coherence.

**Core idea:** Recovery communities prevent drift (people returning to old patterns) using the same principles that keep database systems coherent.

- **Reality Anchor:** Distinguish between people who are genuinely uncertain about recovery vs people who have actively decided to drift
- **Seven Sieves:** Validate before accepting someone into the recovery community
- **Lifeboat Protocol:** When someone's recovery trajectory becomes incoherent, systematic recovery process
- **Coherence Matrix:** Measure community health beyond just "people attended"

100+ documented recovery trips later, I realized: **These frameworks apply everywhere.**

## Why Now?

Healthcare systems are hitting scale limits. Data warehouses with multiple sources are becoming incoherent. Enterprise risk portfolios are too complex to manage. AI systems are hallucinating.

**The solution isn't more money, more people, or more complexity. The solution is coherence.**

I've formalized the frameworks that prevent incoherence. Now I'm making them available to organizations that need them.

## Philosophy

### What I Believe

- **Coherence > Complexity:** A complex system that's coherent beats a simple system that's incoherent
- **Systems > Heroics:** Sustainable coherence comes from systematic frameworks, not heroic firefighting
- **Measure What Matters:** Volume metrics are easy but useless. Coherence metrics are harder but valuable
- **Prevention > Recovery:** Seven Sieves preventing incoherence beats Lifeboat Protocol recovering from it
- **Real Work > Theory:** Frameworks must work in practice, not just in documentation

### What I Won't Do

- ❌ Sell frameworks as magic bullets
- ❌ Oversell complexity
- ❌ Promise guarantees
- ❌ Work with organizations that don't care about coherence

### What I Will Do

- ✅ Provide honest assessments
- ✅ Work at scale without sacrificing quality
- ✅ Adapt frameworks to your specific context
- ✅ Measure results honestly
- ✅ Stay committed to the work

## Current Focus

**Healthcare Data Coherence:** Working with organizations managing data coherence for 3,000+ provider networks.

**Enterprise Risk Coherence:** Developing frameworks for synthesizing conflicting risk assessments at enterprise scale.

**AI Governance:** Applying coherence frameworks to AI system oversight and hallucination prevention.

**Community Recovery:** Continuing Piscatory Sobriety with focus on systems thinking applied to human communities.

## How to Work With Me

### For Consulting/Implementation:

I'm interested in:
- Organizations with real coherence problems at real scale
- Leaders who understand coherence matters more than volume
- Teams willing to systematize what they've been doing ad-hoc
- 90-day focused engagements (not endless projects)

I'm not interested in:
- Quick fixes or magic bullets
- Organizations that won't measure results
- Endless meetings without action
- Work that doesn't align with my values

### For Collaboration:

I'm open to:
- Partnerships on frameworks
- Contributions to open-source implementations
- Speaking engagements (if audience cares about coherence)
- Mentoring others in systems thinking

### For Learning:

Read the frameworks (open-source, CC BY 4.0). Use them. Share results. Tell me what worked and what didn't.
